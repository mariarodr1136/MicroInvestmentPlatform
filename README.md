## Using Postman üì´

You can use Postman to interact with the API and perform various actions. Below are some common operations:

### Start the Backend and Frontend

- To start the backend:
  ```bash
  node index.js
- To start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   
### Register a New User
Use the following steps to register a new user using Postman:

- URL: http://localhost:5001/api/users/register
- Method: POST
- Body: Set the body type to JSON and include user details like this:
  
   ```bash
  {
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "testuser@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
  }

### Get User Portfolio
Once you have a valid user ID (let‚Äôs say it is 60d21b4667d0d8992e610c85), you can use that ID to get the user's portfolio:

- http://localhost:5001/api/users/60d21b4667d0d8992e610c85/portfolio
- Method: GET

### Fixing the URL in Your Frontend
Once you have a user ID, update your App.js like this:

- const userId = '60d21b4667d0d8992e610c85'

### Fetch User Portfolio in Postman
You can also test the endpoint to get the user's portfolio using Postman:

- URL: http://localhost:5001/api/users/671e97b055d22be8e9600518/portfolio
- Method: GET

This should return an empty array ([]) since you just registered the user and there are no stocks in the portfolio yet.

### Add Some Stocks (Optional)
If you want to add stocks to the user's portfolio and see them in your application, you can create a POST request to your buy stock endpoint:

- URL: http://localhost:5001/api/transactions/buy
- Method: POST
- Body: Set the body type to JSON and include stock purchase details, like this:

   ```bash
   {
  "userId": "671e97b055d22be8e9600518",
  "symbol": "AAPL",  // Example stock symbol
  "shares": 5        // Number of shares to buy
   }
